Files in examples directories came from @issacgriffith via Dr. Thomas W Bennet at Mississippi College and are a part of his collection of Lecture examples, or the advanced examples came from the book "Ruby by Example: Concepts and Code" written by Kevin C. Baird.All code has been documented to reflect this fact. Extra notes by me.
