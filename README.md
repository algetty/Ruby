Files in examples directories came from @issacgriffith via... 
1. Dr. Thomas W Bennet at Mississippi College and are a part of his collection of Lecture examples
2. the book "Ruby by Example: Concepts and Code" written by Kevin C. Baird.

All code has been documented to reflect this fact. Extra notes by me.

All other .rb files were course assignments from @issacgriffith
